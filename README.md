# Refocus

> ## Get started now with our [QuickStart](https://salesforce.github.io/refocus/docs/01-quickstart.html) guide!

Refocus is a platform for visualizing the health and status of systems and/or services under observation. Check out our [home page](https://salesforce.github.io/refocus) and our [docs](https://salesforce.github.io/refocus/docs/00-welcome).

## Features
- API for everything
- Pluggable lenses
- Self-service
- Easy deployment to Heroku

## Quickstart

See the [Quickstart](https://salesforce.github.io/refocus/docs/01-quickstart.html) guide to get going with Refocus!

## Securing Refocus
1. Set the DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable before running the app; the default admin user will be created with the password you supply. If you do not set this the app will fail to start. For non-production environments, you can skip this step and it will be initialized with password "devPassword".
1. After installation, log in (UI or API) as `admin@refocus.admin` with the password you set. Delete the environment variable.
1. Create a new user record for yourself with your real email address, and set your profile to the `Admin` profile.
1. If you want to restrict access to specific IP ranges, see [IP Restrictions](#ip-restrictions) below.
1. If you want to use your own single sign-on (SSO) user authentication service, see [Authentication](#authentication) below.
1. New users are assigned to the "RefocusUser" profile by default. This profile has read/write permission to all resource types. If you would like to restrict a class of users to have only read access to certain resource types, you can update the ____Access fields in the "RefocusUser" profile record. <!-- 1. Invite other users. Note: by default, only users with the `Admin` profile will be able to invite other users. If you want to let users register themselves as Refocus users, an Admin must set the config parameter `SELF_REGISTRATION_ENABLED` to `true`. -->
1. If you *only* want SSO users (no "Local Authentation" users), set environment variable `REJECT_LOCAL_USER_REGISTRATION` to `true`. This disables the `POST /v1/register` endpoint.
1. Set environment variable `SESSION_SECRET` to sign the session ID cookie. (When deploying on Heroku, this will be generated automatically for you.)
1. Set environment variable `SECRET_TOKEN` to create jwt tokens used for authentication. (When deploying on Heroku, this will be generated automatically for you.)
1. You can automatically delete unused tokens based on a threshold you
    define. Turn on this feature by defining two environment variables, 
    one to set the schedule for the clock job and the other to set the
    threshold for what to consider *unused*.
    * Use environment variable name
        `CLOCK_JOB_INTERVAL_deleteUnusedTokens` to set the frequency of
        the clock job, i.e. how often should we check for unused tokens.
        Set the value to a time offset like `12h` if you want to run the
        clock job every twelve hours or `1d` if you want to run the job
        once a day.
    * Use environment variable name `DELETE_UNUSED_TOKENS_SINCE` to set
        the threshold of what we should consider "unused". Set the value
        to a negative time offset like `-30d` if you want to consider a
        token unused if it has not been used in the last 30 days.
1. If you want to require SSL for connections from Refocus Collectors to the remote data sources, set environment variable ``COLLECTOR_REQUIRE_SSL_TO_REMOTE_DATA_SOURCE`` to ``true.``

### IP Restrictions
By default, there are no IP restrictions for Refocus access. An admin can configure IP restrictions by adding a config var in Heroku with name ```IP_WHITELIST``` and value array of IP ranges, eg. ```[ [1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.8], [7.6.5.4, 7.6.9.9], [8.8.8.8, 9.9.9.9] ]```. Only the specified IP ranges will be allowed access to Refocus.

### Authentication
#### Local Authentication only. SSO is not enabled.
A user should sign up with Refocus using register page or POST to /v1/register. Once registered, the user can sign in using Local authentication - username/password on Refocus login page.

#### SSO enabled with Local authentication.
##### Non-SSO users
Non-SSO users should authenticate with Refocus as described above using Local Authentication.

##### SSO-Users
If Single Sign On (SSO) is configured in Refocus, SSO users can login using 'SSO Login' button on login page. In case of local authentication with username/password, SSO users will be considered as unregistered user unless they sign up using register page or POST to /v1/register. Once an SSO user is registered with SSO username, the user can sign in using local authentication as well.

### Using API Access Tokens
See [docs](https://salesforce.github.io/refocus/docs/10-security.html#api-tokens).

### Dummy SSO Password
When using SSO, a placeholder user record is created and added to the database. Specify a dummy password string for these dummy records. This dummy password is never used for authentication.

## Perspective Debugging
If you are troubleshooting realtime event handling in a perspective, add query parameter `debug=REALTIME` to any perspective URL. This turns on console logging in the browser for all the realtime subject and sample events the perspective receives.

## API Documentation
The API is self-documenting based on [`./api/v1/swagger.yaml`](./api/v1/swagger.yaml). Start your server and open `MY_HOST:MY_PORT/v1/docs` for interactive documentation of all the Refocus API endpoints.

## Useful Resources
- Redis [command line interface](http://redis.io/commands)
