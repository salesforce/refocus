## Quickstart

See the [Quickstart](https://salesforce.github.io/refocus/docs/01-quickstart.html) guide to get going with Refocus!

## Securing Refocus
1. After installation, log in (UI or API) as `admin@refocus.admin` with password `password` and change the password for that account.
1. Create a new user record for yourself with your real email address, and set your profile to the `Admin` profile.
1. If you want to restrict access to specific IP ranges, see [IP Restrictions](#ip-restrictions) below.
1. If you want to use your own single sign-on (SSO) user authentication service, see [Authentication](#authentication) below.
1. Invite other users. Note: by default, only users with the `Admin` profile will be able to invite other users. If you want to let users register themselves as Refocus users, an Admin must set the config parameter `SELF_REGISTRATION_ENABLED` to `true`.

### IP Restrictions
By default, there are no IP restrictions for Refocus access. An admin can configure IP restrictions by adding a config var in Heroku with name ```IP_WHITELIST``` and value array of IP ranges, eg. ```[ [1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.8], [7.6.5.4, 7.6.9.9], [8.8.8.8, 9.9.9.9] ]```. Only the specified IP ranges will be allowed access to Refocus.

### Authentication
#### Local Authentication only. SSO is not enabled.
A user should sign up with Refocus using register page or POST to /v1/register. Once registered, the user can sign in using Local authentication - username/password on Refocus login page.

#### SSO enabled with Local authentication.
##### Non-SSO users
Non-SSO users should authenticate with Refocus as described above using Local Authentication.

##### SSO-Users
If Single Sign On (SSO) is configured in Refocus, SSO users can login using 'SSO Login' button on login page. In case of local authentication with username/password, SSO users will be considered as unregistered user unless they sign up using register page or POST to /v1/register. Once an SSO user is registered with SSO username, the user can sign in using local authentication as well.

### Using API Access Tokens
See [docs](https://salesforce.github.io/refocus/docs/10-security.html#api-tokens).

## Perspective Debugging
If you are troubleshooting realtime event handling in a perspective, add query parameter `debug=REALTIME` to any perspective URL. This turns on console logging in the browser for all the realtime subject and sample events the perspective receives.

## API Documentation
The API is self-documenting based on [`./api/v1/swagger.yaml`](./api/v1/swagger.yaml). Start your server and open `MY_HOST:MY_PORT/v1/docs` for interactive documentation of all the Refocus API endpoints.

## Useful Resources
- Redis [command line interface](http://redis.io/commands)
- [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en) for testing API calls
- Node.js [token-based authentication](https://scotch.io/tutorials/authenticate-a-node-js-api-with-json-web-tokens)
