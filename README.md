## Features
- API for everything
- Pluggable lenses
- Self-service
- Easy deployment to Heroku

## Installation
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
1. Install [PostgreSQL](http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload). Be sure to read the "PostgreSQL One Click Installer README" and follow the instructions there to adjust your shared memory as needed.
1. Install [Redis](http://redis.io/download).
1. Clone this git repository.
1. Run `cd refocus`.
1. Create a new branch: ```git checkout -b <your branch name> master```
1. Run `npm install`. This downloads and installs project dependencies and executes the post-install steps. Note: don't run this with sudo! You may get some weird errors later.
1. Install lunchy (`brew install Caskroom/cask/lunchy`). This will help you start redis.
1. Run `lunchy start redis` to start redis.
1. Run `npm start` to start your Node.js server at http://localhost:3000.
1. If you want to unload some of the processing to a background process run `npm run start-clock`. If you intend to deploy this on heroku and have heroku toolbelt installed run `heroku local` to start both the web and the background process.

### Updates
Whenever you pull down a new version of Refocus from the git repository:

1. Run `npm update` to make sure you have all the latest dependencies.
1. Run `npm start` to start your Node.js server at http://localhost:3000.

## Development
- Run `npm run build` and modify the webpack.config.js to take advantage of react hot module reload (react-hmr), for faster front-end development.
- At times the generated pages don't show due to this error in the browser console: `locals[0] does not appear to be a 'module' object with Hot Module replacement API enabled`. This can happen when the NODE_ENV is blank. To fix the issue, set the NODE_ENV to a non-empty value, then run the build again.
- If you want any of the packages to send output to stdout, you can start your server with `DEBUG=* node .` or you can spell out which packages you want to show debug output, e.g. `DEBUG=express*,swagger* node .`.
- Use [nodemon](http://nodemon.io/) to monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.
- Use Node.js [Debugger](https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html).
- If you are making changes to the code, check for adherence to style guidelines by running `gulp style`.
- If you are making any changes to the DB schema, create a migration using `node_modules/.bin/sequelize migration:create --name example-name`

### Package Scripts
Execute any of the scripts in the `scripts` section of [`./package.json`](./package.json) by calling `npm run [SCRIPTNAME]`, e.g. `npm run test` or `npm run lint` or `npm run start`.

## Usage

> TODO

## How redis is used
On node server startup, two redis clients are instantiated:
The ```publisher``` is called by the sequelize ORM when a subject or sample is inserted/updated/deleted. It publishes a serialized object keyed by the record type (i.e. ```subject``` or ```sample```) and containing the object which was inserted/updated/deleted.
The ```subscriber``` parses the message string into an object then uses socket.io to broadcast the changes out to any connected browser clients.
After installing the server, you can run ```redis-cli``` to issue commands to redis server. Command to show active channels is: ```PUBSUB CHANNELS *```

## Running on Heroku
- Setup Heroku account and toolbelt (follow this guide https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction)
- Run ```heroku create``` to create Heroku project
- If you are not in a private space run ```PGSSLMODE=require``` to make all db data go over ssl
- Run ```heroku config:set NODE_ENV=test```
- Run ```heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev``` to create a dev db
- Run ```git push heroku <your branch>:master``` which will push to Heroku and start up a dyno.
- Run ```heroku open``` and view the app running in Heroku
- Run ```heroku run bash``` then run ```mocha``` to execute the test suite
- If you are running the app in more than one dyno, you will need to force the client to communicate with the server only using websockets. To do so, set the config variable SOCKETIO_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL to websocket or run ```heroku config:set SOCKETIO_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL=websocket```
If you are running on Heroku and you want to use Google Analytics, store your tracking id in a Heroku config variable called `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`.

### Troubleshooting a Heroku deployment
- Log errors in suspected areas. Use the logging in the error handler
- For errors 'Relation __ does not exist', the db is not set up properly. Try resetting the database. Run ```heroku run bash``` to enter shell script mode, then run ```gulp resetdb```, to reset the db
- Run ```heroku restart```, to restart the app
- Run ```heroku logs --tail``` to see the heroku logs, as they update

## Setup Production Environment on Localhost
If not already setup, follow Installation instructions to setup Refocus. Execute the following commands to setup production environment and corresponding config variables:

```
export NODE_ENV=production
export DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/focusdb'
npm start
```

## Securing Refocus
1. After installation, log in (UI or API) as `admin@refocus.admin` with password `password` and change the password for that account.
1. Create a new user record for yourself with your real email address, and set your profile to the `Admin` profile.
1. If you want to restrict access to specific IP ranges, see [IP Restrictions](#ip-restrictions) below.
1. If you want to use your own single sign-on (SSO) user authentication service, see [Authentication](#authentication) below.
1. Invite other users. Note: by default, only users with the `Admin` profile will be able to invite other users. If you want to let users register themselves as Refocus users, an Admin must set the config parameter `SELF_REGISTRATION_ENABLED` to `true`.

### IP Restrictions
By default, there are no IP restrictions for Refocus access. An admin can configure IP restrictions by adding a config var in Heroku with name ```IP_WHITELIST``` and value array of IP ranges, eg. ```[ [1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.8], [7.6.5.4, 7.6.9.9], [8.8.8.8, 9.9.9.9] ]```. Only the specified IP ranges will be allowed access to Refocus.

### Authentication
#### Local Authentication only. SSO is not enabled.
A user should sign up with Refocus using register page or POST to /v1/register. Once registered, the user can sign in using Local authentication - username/password on Refocus login page.

#### SSO enabled with Local authentication.
##### Non-SSO users
Non-SSO users should authenticate with Refocus as described above using Local Authentication.

##### SSO-Users
If Single Sign On (SSO) is configured in Refocus, SSO users can login using 'SSO Login' button on login page. In case of local authentication with username/password, SSO users will be considered as unregistered user unless they sign up using register page or POST to /v1/register. Once an SSO user is registered with SSO username, the user can sign in using local authentication as well.

### Using API Access Tokens
- A token is required for API calls when Refocus config has `useAccessToken` set to `true`.
- New users should register to get API access token. A user can POST to the `/v1/register` endpoint to generate a token. Save this token for future use.
- Existing users can POST to the `/v1/token` endpoint to retrieve new token.
- To use the token for API access, add a Header with `Key:Authorization` and `Value: "token returned"` to your API call.
- When using [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en) to make an API call, set Body to raw and text to JSON.

## Perspective Debugging
If you are troubleshooting realtime event handling in a perspective, add query parameter `debug=REALTIME` to any perspective URL. This turns on console logging in the browser for all the realtime subject and sample events the perspective receives.

## API Documentation
The API is self-documenting based on [`./api/v1/swagger.yaml`](./api/v1/swagger.yaml). Start your server and open `MY_HOST:MY_PORT/v1/docs` for interactive documentation of all the Refocus API endpoints.

- Redis [command line interface](http://redis.io/commands)
- [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en) for testing API calls
