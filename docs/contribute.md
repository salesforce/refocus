We couldnâ€™t be more excited about Refocus! It is making a huge impact in how we visualize our service health within Salesforce, and provides a level of transparency that we have never had. 
We set out to create a platform that would:
connect all monitoring sources into one system
quickly onboard new services
visualize the data in ways that make sense
We think we have achieved these goals with a platform that is flexible enough to suit almost any use case. Now that Refocus is open source, we are looking forward to getting more people using and influencing the future of Refocus. We are open to feedback and contributions on our github repo and our excited to see the novel ways people solve their problems with Refocus! 

P.S We will be speaking at dreamforce if you want more details on how Refocus helps Salesforce be transparent.
