# Refocus V2MOM 2018 (Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, Metrics)

## What is a V2MOM?

A V2MOM helps guide us on the work we are going to do this year. 

The vision helps us define what we want to do. The values establish what is most important about the vision; it sets the principles and beliefs that guide it (in priority order). The methods illustrate how we get the job done by outlining the actions and the steps that everyone needs to take. The obstacles identify the challenges, problems, and issues we have to overcome to achieve our vision. Finally, the measures specify the actual result we aim to achieve.

# Vision

We accelerate innovation and improve reliability by giving our customers an intuitive, flexible, and collaborative platform.

# Values

## Trust

Refocus is secure, responsive, and highly available. Data integrity is of the utmost importance.

## Love

Users love Refocus. That goes equally for API users and UI users. Refocus makes our users' jobs easier. Happy users become evangelists, evangelists lead to greater adoption and more community engagement, broader usage, and increased community engagement result in a better platform for *all* users.

## Community

Real open source project. Real adoption. Real community. Community is the cornerstone of a successful open source project—without community, the project *will* wither and die. Community contributions result in a better platform for *all* users.

## Innovation

Refocus is a driver of innovation and platform for innovation. We need to foster new and compelling ideas both within and beyond our team.

# Methods

1. Reliability: Our customers rely on Refocus 24/7 to manage their mission-critical systems. We will improve our logging, enhance our monitoring, improve our testing, and publicize our availability so that we can efficiently deliver a trusted platform. Our goal is for Refocus Core to have 95% code coverage and continuous deployment. Our developers spend less than 15% of their time on bugs.
2. Scale: In order to increase trust in Refocus and grow our community, we are going to improve the performance of Refocus through detailed performance analysis. We are going to support 200 million samples every day and double the number of API requests we can handle without sacrificing performance.
3. Security: Trust is our number one value so we are going to put Refocus through the Threat Monitoring process and mitigate any security issues that arise.
4. IMC: With the new IMC launching this year we need to ensure that Refocus is able to support IMC without sacrificing stability and performance. Additionally, we will enable our customers to create incidents without leaving the Refocus ecosystem.
5. Easy Integration: In order to grow our community and improve our reliability, we are going to deliver a framework that enables service owners to more easily send their real-time data to Refocus.
6. Unified UX: We are going to deliver a unified user experience so that customers can quickly find the information they need. We also want to enable technical and non-technical users to manage their Refocus data through the Refocus UI.
7. API: We are going to deliver a first class real-time API so that customers can leverage Refocus data to create innovative integrations. We are also going to make it easier for users to manage their subject hierarchies.
8. Sharing: In order to grow our Refocus community, we need to bring awareness by sharing customer stories and presenting at industry events. We also want to take open source seriously and will use Github Issues to be more transparent about the work we are doing.

# Obstacles

* Operations require a large percentage of developer time
* Performance issues as we grow our user base
* Resources being moved to other projects
