  title: Refocus API
  description: >-
    Refocus is a platform for visualizing the health and status of systems
    and/or services under observation. Check out our
    [home page](https://salesforce.github.io/refocus),
    [docs](https://salesforce.github.io/refocus/docs/00-welcome) and
    [github](https://github.com/salesforce/refocus) repository.

    ### API Reference

    The Refocus API is a
    [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) API
    which allows client applications to interact with Refocus. We use standard
    HTTP response codes, standard HTTP authentication and
    standard HTTP verbs, all of which make it easy to integrate with lots of
    HTTP clients. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors.
