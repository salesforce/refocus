   * "unused".
   *
   * Use environment variable name "CLOCK_JOB_INTERVAL_deleteUnusedTokens" to
   * set the frequency of the clock job, i.e. how often should we check for
   * unused tokens. Set the value to a time offset like "12h" if you want to
   * run the clock job every twelve hours or "1d" if you want to run the job
   * once a day.
   *
   * Use environment variable name "DELETE_UNUSED_TOKENS_SINCE" to set the
   * threshold of what we should consider "unused". Set the value to a negative
   * time offset like "-30d" if you want to consider a token unused if it has
   * not been used in the last 30 days.
   *
   * @returns {Promise<Object>} containing recordCount and errorCount for
